# CWeatherAPIApp
C# Weather App using the OpenWeatherMap.org API Current Weather forecast.


#What I Learned - 
 - XAML - GUI markup language used with C# WPF applications.
 - Getting user input using a XAML interface and handling the data with C#.
 - Pulling data down from the API using WebClient.
 - Storing the information into the weatherInfo.cs class (using getters and setters).
